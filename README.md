# simpsons-face-detect

Silly script to go through a very large number of Simpsons stills and pick outs
images that contain no faces. These were then used to make After Springfield.

The more fun bit of this script is the small genetic algorithm used to fine-tune
human face detection settings to work better on simpson-like faces.
